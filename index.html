        <div class="content2">
            <p>Recto will replace Benjamin Diokno, who assumed the top Finance post in 2022.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Recto's wife, former Batangas governor Vilma Santos-Recto, was the first to break the news in public.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Santos-Recto made the revelation in an online interview with showbiz columnist Jun Lalin.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>"Manunumpa na siya tomorrow, January 12, bilang bagong (He will be sworn on January 12 as the new) Secretary of Finance under the administration of [President Marcos]. Kasi binigyan siya ng tiwala (He was given the trust) because he is such a good economist," she said.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>There had been rumors that Recto was moving up as Finance secretary since last year, after he accompanied the President to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit last November.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Albay 2nd District Rep. Jose Ma. Clemente "Joey" Salceda welcomed the appointment of Recto as Finance chief, noting that he will bring in a "wealth of experience in economic legislation and deep and longstanding relationships with members of Congress," "I am optimistic that key tax reforms pending in the Senate will also move faster with his appointment, due to his relationships in that chamber, as well as his ability to broker viable compromises," Salceda, chairman of the House Tax Committee, added.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Recto, the grandson of statesman Claro Mayo Recto, was elected as representative of Batangas' sixth district in 2019 after his 12-year stint at the Senate, during which he served as Senate President Pro Tempore or as Senate Minority Leader.</p>

                Good choice Senators welcomed Recto's Cabinet appointment.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
                Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri believes that Recto, who used to be the Senate's "resident numbers genius," would be a good Finance secretary.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
                "In the Senate, we always regarded him as the resident numbers genius. This was not just for his mathematical ability, but more importantly for his ability to immediately see the big picture implications of these numbers," he said.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
                "More than most, he understands how to bridge the gap between the abstractions of mathematics and the very concrete realities that we face as a nation," Zubiri said in a statement Thursday.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
                He expressed confidence that Recto will "continue to push the country along on the road to greater economic prosperity." Senate Minority Leader Aquilino "Koko" Pimentel 3rd and Sen. Francis "Chiz" Escudero welcomed Recto's designation as Finance chief.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
                Pimentel said his appointment was "well deserved." Escudero said Recto is an "able and capable" addition to President Marcos' Cabinet "in ensuring that we continue to sustain the economic gains we have thus far achieved." The senator noted that Recto was a former National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) chief.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> 
                "I wish him well and would like to express my support not only in the CA (Commission on Appointments) but in his endeavors as the new SoF (secretary of Finance)," Escudero said.
